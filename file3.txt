Write a program, which will find all the numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma separated sequence on a single line.

Hint: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. Divide each digit with 2 and verify is it even or not

Solution
values = []
for i in range(1000,3001):
    s = str(i)
    if (int(s[0])%2==0) and (int(s[1])%2==0) and (int(s[2])%2==0) and 
(int(s[3])%2==0):
     print(values.append(s))

print (",".join(values))



Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose if the entered string is: Python0325
Then the output will be:
LETTERS: 6
DIGITS:4

Hint: Use built-in functions ofstring.

Solution
s = “aac34520”
d={"DIGITS":0, "LETTERS":0}
for c in s:
    if c.isdigit():
        d["DIGITS"]+=1
    elif c.isalpha():
        d["LETTERS"]+=1
    else:
        pass
print("LETTERS", d["LETTERS"])
print("DIGITS", d["DIGITS"])


Design a code which will find the given number is Palindrome number or not.

Hint: Use built-in functions of string.

Solution
# change this value for a different output
my_str = 'aIbohPhoBiA'

# make it suitable for caseless comparison
my_str = my_str.casefold()

# reverse the string
rev_str = reversed(my_str)


# check if the string is equal to its reverse
if list(my_str) == list(rev_str):

    print("It is palindrome")
else:
    print("It is not palindrome")
