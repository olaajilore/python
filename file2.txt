Write a program which will find factors of given number and find whether the factor is even or odd.
Hint: Use Loop with if-else statements
num=50

for i in range(1,num+1):
    rem=num%i
    if(rem==0):
        if(i%2==0):
            print("Factor is even:",i)
        else:
            print("factor is odd: ",i)
    else:
        pass


Write a code which accepts a sequence of words as input and prints the words in a sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Hint: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.



my_str = "Welcome to Python"

# breakdown the string into a list of words
words = my_str.split()

# sort the list
words.sort()

# display the sorted words
print("The sorted words are:")
for word in words:
    print(word)
